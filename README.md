The microbiome dataset utilized in this project is used with permission from [Gdanetz, K., & Trail, F. 2017](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PBIOMES-05-17-0023-R).

Wheat plants were sampled from a wheat/maize/soybean crop rotation site that implements four different crop management strategies (conventional/no till/low input/organic). The plants were sampled (leaves, stems and roots) three times during the growing season and the fungal communities are analyzed. The experimental design is randomized treatments with 4 treatments (crop management) and 6 replications.

This work aims to determine if the wheat fungal endophytic communities differ by management strategy.
