# Wheat_microbiomeRepro

The data for this project is a microbiome dataset. Wheat plants were sampled from a wheat/maize/soybean crop rotation site that implements four different crop management strategies (conventional/no till/low input/organic). The plants were sampled (leaves, stems and roots) three times during the growing season and the fungal communities are analyzed. The experimental design is randomized treatments with 4 treatments (crop management) and 6 replications.

This works aims to determine if the wheat fungal endophytic communities differ by management strategy.
